I will be making a function that creates a random array of characters and sorts them into numbers, letters and miscellaneous characters.

The function now successfully sorts the three categories and prints it's results.

The JUNIT Test now tests if the program sorts by letters, numbers and miscellaneous properly and checks if the createArray() method creates a non-empty array.
